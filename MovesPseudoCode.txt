int current; /* current is 1 for the player and -1 for player 2/the AI */

/* When moving a chip on the bar, start will be the opoonent's end space */
/* If there are no open spaces for a chip on the bar to move to,
    then the rest of the round is skipped */

open_spaces(int start, int die_roll, int current){
    /* Shows the open spaces of a particular dice roll*/
    If that space is the end goal and (all of the current's chips are
    either in the last five spaces or the end goal),
	that space is available
    Else if the space has one or less of the opponent's chips,
	that space is available
    Else,
	that space is unavailable


move(int start, int die_roll, int current)
    Subtracts one chip from the start
    If there is one opponent chip in the space to move to,
        Move that opponent's chip to the bar
	Add one chip to the space to move to
